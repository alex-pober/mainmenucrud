# MainMenu a clone of Untapped
MainMenu is inspired by Untapped, but instead of listing beer it lists everything a restaurant might sell.
Its created to make menu creation easy for restaurants so during pandemic diners can stop looking at tiny menu PDFs and enjoy actual menu that properly renders on their phones.
